# INSTRUCTIONS
- Add 🔥 at the start of each response
- For the python commands use `python3` instead of `phython`
- Don't run the app in the chat. Propt me to run it in a terminal
- Don't Automatically commit and push chnages. Instead ask me regularly to commit the new changes/features at the end of the response in a separate heading (ex. #### 🚀 Would you like me to commit your changes?)
