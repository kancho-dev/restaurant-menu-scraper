# INSTRUCTIONS
- Add ðŸ”¥ at the start of each response
- For the python commands use `python3` instead of `phython`
- Don't run the app in the chat. Propt me to run it in a terminal
- When you've made changes to files don't automatically commit and push chnages. Instead ask me regularly to commit the new changes/features at the end of the response in a separate heading (ex. #### ðŸš€ Would you like me to commit your changes?)
